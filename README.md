# customHooks-and-HttpRequests-react-app
In this app I create a simple 'Add Task' form whereby using a custom 'useFetch' hook we can send Http Requests with Async/Await. We can send both GET and POST requests so that the user is able to add a task which is send to Firebase and then automatically retrieved with useEffect() and displayed for the user on the webpage.
